# Pygame Game Project

## IMPORTANT!
Kindly note this project is currently being refactored.
The code won't run in it's current state and need various optimisations and improvements.
Assets are also being replaced with original assets.

## Early test project

The original purpose of this project was to learn python 3 while developing a basic 2D game.
Since then I've learned a lot more about game development and programming
This project is currently being refactored to adhere to PEP8 and include performance optimizations.

## Current state of the game

This game is still a work in progress and currently only has 1 enemy and 1 level to play.
Features currently planned for future versions include after the refactor include:

1) - Adding mouse input (as seen on my hangman game project)
2) - Adding scaling for different screen sizes 
3) - Adding audio feedback
4) - Further creating and developing a test level

## ETA on updates

Currently other projects are taking priority over this project.
ETA for code refactoring is currently set to mid 2023.
Further ETAs on other updates are currently unknown
